### Hi there, I'm Tim ðŸ‘‹

I'm a senior at **Rice University** majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Entrepreneurship, with plans to pursue a Master's in Computer Science.

I love competing in hackathons and hacking away at on cool side projects. Here are a few things I've worked on:
- Founded a startup to help local restaurants stay afloat in the wake of the pandemic, and received funding from Rice's Lilie Lab.
- [Solved Rubik's Cubes underwater](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpgDliOu9sA) for Salesforce's talent show 
- Collaborated with student government to create and launch an app to the Google Play Store
